# Capstone: Case Studies that demonstrate
# some of these simulation techniques

# Epidemiology: The study of the spread of disease.
# Math/Statistical models of how disease spreads.

## Susceptible, Infected, and Removed (SIR) Model
# Individuals are one of these three types:
# Susceptible: Not yet caught disease
# Infected: Currently have the disease
# Removed: Have had the disease and recovered
# and are now immune.

# We measure time in discrete steps. At each
# step, each infected can infect susceptibles
# or can recover (or die), at which point the
# infected is removed.

# At time t, have some # of S, I and R:
# S(t) = number of susceptibles at time t;
# I(t) = number of infected at time t;
# R(t) = number of removed at time t;

# At each time t, each I (Infected) has:
# 1. prob a of infecting a susceptible; and
# 2. prob b of being removed

# At time 0 (start):
# S(0) = N; # so total pop is N + 1 and fixed
# I(0) = 1;
# R(0) = 0 (zero);

# Total population is fixed at N + 1. That is
# S(t) + I(t) + R(t) = N + 1 for all t;

# Four rules / assumptions / rv derivations:

# Each time step t, the chance a susceptible
# remains uninfected is (1-a)^I(t).

# If susceptible fails to become infected,
# this implies S(t+1)~binom(S(t),(1-a)^I(t))

# Since each infected has chance b of being
# removed: R(t+1)~R(t)+binom(I(t),b)

# From 2 and 3 above we get I(t+1) from total
# pop: I(t+1)=N+1-R(t+1)-S(t+1)

# Now we have enough information to write a
# simulation of an SIR process:

# program spuRs/resources/scripts/SIRsim.r
# returns a (T+1 x 3) matrix of values for S, I, R

##### BRANCHING PROCESSES

# Branching processes alter the spatial
# restrictions and implications of SIR.
# Branching process ignores finite population
# restriction and is a good model for early
# stages of an epidemic.

# Branching processes are described in terms
# of births and population growth rather than
# infection. If Z-sub-n is the size of the
# population at generation/time n, at each
# step every individual independently gives
# birth to a random number of offspring, with
# distribution X, then dies

# If Z at time 0 is 1, then we can say
# Z at time n+1 = X-sub-n,1+...+X-sub-n, sub-z-n
# where X sub-n,i is the i-th family size
# in generation n

# Program spuRs/resources/scripts/bp.r

# Uses ... for passing a variable number
# on inputs to a function:
bp <- function(gen, rv.sim, ...) {
  # population of a branching process

## Forest Fire Model
# Forest fire model incorporates spatial
# interactions. Like SIR, we suppose that 
# we have a population made up of susceptible
# (unburnt), infected (on fire), and removed
# (burnt out) individuals.

# The difference is that the individuals are
# placed on a grid and an infected individual
# can only infect a susceptible person if they
# are neighbors.

# At each step an infected individual has
# probability a of infecting each of its eight
# (each corner) susceptible neighbors.

# So for a susceptible individual, the proba-
# bility of remaining uninfected is (1-a)^x
# where x is the number of infected neighbors.

# After having a chance to infect its
# neighbors, an individual is removed with
# probability b.

# If you play around with this you will see
# that there is still a threshold below
# which the fire rarely gets going but above
# which there is a chance that is can grow
# quite fast and large.

# Is a balance between how fast new infections
# appear and how fast infected individuals are
# removed.
