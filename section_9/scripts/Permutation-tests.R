#####       PERMUTATION TESTS       #####
#########################################

# Permutation tests are based on resampling
# without replacement.

# Saw one use with the streakiness baseball
# example.

# Are often applied as non-parametric test
# of general hypothesis:  H0: F = G
# versus alt hyp H1: F not equal to G,
# where F and G are two unspecified distri-
# butions.

# Under null hypothese, two samples from F
# and G, and the pooled sample, are all random
# samples from the same distribution F.

# Replicates of a two-sample test statistic
# that compares the distributions are generated
# by resampling without replacement from the
# pooled sample.

# Can do tests of independence, association,
# location, common scale, etc.

# newly hatched chicks are randomly allocated
# into six groups, each group given a different
# feed supplement. We look at their weight in
# grams after six weeks along with feed types:

require(stats); require(graphics)
# this plot from documentation:
# 'notches' indicate sig differences
boxplot(weight ~ feed, data = chickwts,

        notch = TRUE,

# suggests is a significant difference by feed:
anova(fm1 <- lm(weight ~ feed, 
                data = chickwts))

            # adjust outer margins
            oma = c(0, 0, 1.1, 0),
            # adjusts lines in margins

# We are interested in the differences
# in weight resulting from soybean
# and linseed groups:

# get sorted weights for soybeen-eaters:
x <- sort(as.vector(weight[feed == "soybean"]))

# get sorted weights for linseed-eaters:
y <- sort(as.vector(weight[feed == "linseed"]))

# question is: Are means different?

mean(x) # can observe it is 246.43
mean(y) # can observe it is 218.75

# Could do a two-sample t-test but
# in this case, the population distri-
# butions for the weights are unknown.

# The significance level can be computed
# from the permutation distribution without
# knowing distributional assumptions

# sample sizes are n=14 and m=12 so
# there are a total of (n+m)!/(n!)(m!)
# 9,657,700 different partitions of the
# pooled sample into two subsets of
# sizes 14 and 12. We can simulate
# without replicating 9M.

# t-stat from the original two sets?:

### Example: Permutation distribution 
### of the K-S statistic   

# What if we wanted to test for any type of
# distributional difference in the two groups. 

# Could use Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic D
# is the maximum absolute difference between
# the ecdf's of the two samples
