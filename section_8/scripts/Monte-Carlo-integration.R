# Here we cover two simulation-based approaches
# to integration (1) Hit-and-miss; and the 
# (2) Improved Monte Carlo Integration method.

# Moving into two dimensions (negative numbers
# for y), must subtract area under curve for
# negative values of y.

## HIT-AND-MISS METHOD (SEE SLIDES)

# But we want I which = |A| + c(b - a)
# So if we can estimate |A| then we can
# estimate I.

# To estimate |A| imagine throwing
# darts randomly (and uniformly).
# On average the proportion that land under
# the curve will be given by the area of A
# A is the shaded area under curve.

# Then assume both X and Y are uniform.
# Have interval a, b along x, assume have y
# interval f(x) = c, d within x = a, b

  # ftn is a function of one variable x.
  # [a, b] is the range of integration
  # f.min and f.max are y bounds on 
  # ftn over the range [a, b]
  # that is f.min <= ftn(x) <= f.max 
  # for all x in [a, b]
  # n is the number of samples used 
  # in the estimation
  # that is the number of calls made 
  # to the function ftn

## (IMPROVED) MONTE-CARLO INTEGRATION

# Hit-and-Miss converges very slowly. This is
# the technique people usually refer to as
# "Monte-Carlo Integration".

# When we say one Monte-Carlo technique is
# 'better', we mean that, using the same number
# of function calls, it has a smaller variance.

# SInce the estimates that we are making are based
# on random samples, they are themselves random
# samples.

# We consider the same integral I over interval
# a, b for f(x)dx.
