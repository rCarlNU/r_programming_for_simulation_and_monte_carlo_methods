## CHAPTER 11 is about approximating the 
## area under a continuous function within 
## interval a, b (is the concept of the
## integral in calculus). All three approaches
## divide up the interval into n segments 
## that each have width h and then approximate
## the area of each n segments and add these
## areas together for total area.

## Three approaches to do this:
# 1) Trapezoidal rule
# 2) Simpson's rule
# 3) Adaptive quadrature

# 1) Trapezoidal rule - approximate area with a series of
#    trapezoids...'straight line rule' or polynomial of
#    degree 1...works reasonably well...we also demonstrate 
#    that as n increases, the approximation improves. Also:
# 1a)Trapezoid rule gives exact result if f is a constant
#    or a linear function, otherwise there is some error.
# 1b)PGMs: trapezoid.r

# 2) Simpson's rule - subdivide interval[a,b] into n 
#    even number of subintervals. On each consecutive
#    pair of subintervals (the 'even' n's) approximate
#    behavior of f(x) by a parabola (polynomial of
#    degree 2) instead of straight line. In the
#    summation of the interval areas, simpson's rule:
# 2a)Weights f(x-sub-i) by 2x if i even (not 0 or n)
#    or by 4x if i is odd
# 2b)Provides exact estimate (no error) if f(x) is
#    quadratic (see quadratic function definition in
#    Wikipedia), also exact if f(x) is cubic.
# 2c)Generally gives superior results to trapezoidal.
# 2d)PGMs: simpson_n.r; Phi.r ("Big Phi" estimates
#    cumulative normal cdf); phi.r ("little phi"
#    estimates normal values of y given x);
#    simpson_test.r tests convergence to exact
#    interal when n increases; simpson.r - uses
#    tolerance level instead of partition size n.

# 3) Adaptive Quadrature -

  # we assume a < b and n is a positive integer;
  # h is width of each interval;
  h <- (b-a)/n
  # x.vec is vector from a to b that also marks
  # beginning and end of each subinterval:
  x.vec <- seq(a, b, by = h)
  # Given ftn is f(x), f.vec computes values of y
  # for each x-sub-i marking the intervals.
  # sapply below could be replaced with ftn(x.vec):
  f.vec <- sapply(x.vec, ftn)
  # Implements trapezoid rule, adds up the areas:

# Note ftn6 below is vectorized (given vector as input
# it will return a vector as output). Thus, in trapezoid
# sapply(x.vec,ftn) could be replaced by ftn(x.vec). The
# only advantage of using sapply is that it will work
# even if ftn is not vectorized.

# The trapezoid rule gives exact results if f is constant
# or a linear function, otherwise there will be an error,
# corresponding to the extent that our trapezoidal approximation
# overshoots or undershoots the actual graph of f.

  n <- max(c(2*(n %/% 2), 4))
  # h is width of intervals
  h <- (b-a)/n
  # odd x-sub-i (.02) segments from a (0) to b (1):

  # because appear in 4 intervals;
  # f(x-sub-i) for i even (except 0 and n) weighted 2
  # because appear in 2 intervals;

# Important points:
# 1) Simpson's rule gives exact results if f(x) quadratic
# function since approximates each piece with parabola;
# 2) Also exact if f(x) is cubic
# 3) Generally better approx than trapezoidal rule.
